WildMIDI is a simple software midi player which has a core softsynth
library that can be used in other applications.

The WildMIDI library uses Gravis Ultrasound patch files to convert MIDI
files into audio, which is then passed back to the calling application.
The library API is designed so that it is easy to include WildMIDI into
applications that wish to include MIDI file playback.

### CHANGELOG

#### 0.4.6
* A lot of player cleanup and refactoring, thanks to initial work
  by Azamat H. Hackimov, with addition of several safeguards and
  minor fixes.
* Ability to choose which audio output backends to include in the
  build system: see the `cmake` script for the relevant `WANT_???`
  options. Player's `--help` command line switch lists the available
  backends. Thanks to initial work by Azamat H. Hackimov.
* New native audio output backends for player: coreaudio for macOS,
  sndio for OpenBSD, netbsd (sunaudio) for NetBSD.
* Improved `pkg-config` file generation in `cmake` script (bug #236).
* Workaround a link failure on AmigaOS4 with newer SDKs (bug #241).
* Other minor source clean-ups.
* CMake project clean-ups. Cmake v3.4 or newer is now required.

#### 0.4.5
* Fixed MUS drum channels 9 and 15 being swapped if the same file
  is played twice from the same memory buffer (bug #234).
* Player: Fixed save midi reading wrong argv if there are no path
  seperators (bug #227).
* Other code and build system clean-ups.

#### 0.4.4
* Fixed integer overflow in midi parser sample count calculation
 (bug #200).
* Fixed 8-bit ping pong GUS patch loaders (bug #207).
* Fixed wrong variable use in reverb code (bug #210).
* Reset block status of tty after playback (bug #211).
* Fixed broken file name handling for 'save as midi' command during
  playback.
* Clamp MUS volume commands (PR #226).
* CMake project improvements (bugs: #214, #216, #217, #218); cmake
  version 3.1 or newer is now required.

#### 0.4.3
* New API addition: `WildMidi_InitVIO()`.  It is like `WildMidi_Init()`,
  but tells the library to use caller-provided functions for file IO.
  See `wildmidi_lib.h` or the man page `WildMidi_InitVIO(3)` for details.
  This was suggested and implemented by Christian Breitwieser.
* Fixed Visual Studio optimized builds (bug #192, function ptr issue.)
* Fixed a thinko in one of the buffer size checks added in v0.4.2.
* Fixed possible out of bounds reads in sysex commands (bug #190).
* Fixed invalid reads during config parse with short patch file names.
* Do not treat a missing end-of-track marker as an error for type-0
  midi files (bug #183).
* Fixed bad reading of high delta values in XMI converter (bug #199).
* Fixed a memory leak when freeing a midi (bug #204).
* Fixed slurred/echoy playback at quick tempos on looped instruments
  (bug #185).
* Fixed certain midis sounding different compared to timidity, as if
  instruments not turned off (bug #186).
* Fixed compilation on systems without `libm`.
* Support for RISC OS, Nintendo Switch, and PS Vita.
* Several clean-ups.

#### 0.4.2
* Fixed CVE-2017-11661, CVE-2017-11662, CVE-2017-11663, CVE-2017-11664
  (bug #175).
* Fixed CVE-2017-1000418 (bug #178).
* Fixed a buffer overflow during playback with malformed midi files
  (bug #180).
* GUS patch processing changes to meet users expectations (bug #132).
* Worked around a build failure with newer FreeBSD versions failing to
  retrieve the ONLCR constant (bug #171).
* Fixed a minor Windows unicode issue (PR #170).
* A few other fixes / clean-ups.

#### 0.4.1
* Fixed bug in handling of the "source" directive in config files.
* Fixed a nasty bug in `dBm_pan_volume`. Other fixes and clean-ups.

* Support for AmigaOS and its variants like MorphOS and AROS.

#### 0.4.0
* API change: The library now returns audio data in host-endian format,
  not little-endian.

  numeric version macros in the `wildmidi_lib.h` header. The dso version
  is changed from 1 to 2.
* API change: All long or unsigned long type `_WM_Info` fields changed
  into strictly 32-bit fields (`int32_t` or `uint32_t`.)
* API change: `WildMidi_OpenBuffer()` and `WildMidi_GetOutput()` changed
  to accept strictly 32-bit size parameters (e.g., `uint32_t`) instead of
  unsigned long.
* API change: `WildMidi_ConvertToMidi()` and `WildMidi_ConvertBufferToMidi()`
  added for MIDI-like files to be converted to MIDI.
* API change: `WildMidi_SetCvtOption()` added to support conversion options.
* API change: `WildMidi_SongSeek()` added to support Type 2 MIDI files.
* API change: `WildMidi_GetLyric()` added to support embedded text, 
  such as KAR files.

  Thanks Ryan Nunn for releasing his code under the LGPL.
* Support for loading MUS (MUS Id format) files, such as from Doom.

* Handle cfg files with mac line-endings.
* Refuse loading suspiciously long files.

  Beethoven's Fur Elise.rmi at 44100 Hz using the old MIDIA patch-set
  from 1994.
